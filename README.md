# 🎮 OOP1 RPG – The Final Compilation

## 📌 Project Overview

**OOP1 RPG – The Final Compilation** is a console-based role-playing game developed as part of our **Object-Oriented Programming 1** course. The game demonstrates core OOP principles such as **Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Abstraction** through an interactive RPG experience.

Players are transported into another dimension, choose a character class, battle enemies across different worlds, defeat bosses, and progress through a story-driven adventure.
